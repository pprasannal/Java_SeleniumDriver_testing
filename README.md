Page Object: it is a class that represents a web page and hold the functionality and members.
Page Factory: it is a way to initialize the web elements you want to interact with within the page object when you create an instance of it.
Repository Object: An object repository is a centralized storage of locators in the form of objects. QAs store all the element locators in a separate file, also referred to as a property file (.properties) in Selenium. The property file stores information in a key-value pair format. This file serves as an object repository in Selenium WebDriver
